#### Kotlin - Collections is Java Collections!!

> Kotlin uses Java's collection
> But Kotlin adds a number of new features through __extension__ functions

THere are two types of collection object: mutable & immutable

Example: <br>
Immutable

```
val names = listof("Alex", "Suraj", "Swamy")
val hashMapNames = hashMapOf("Swamy" to 1, "Suraj" to 2) 
val setNames = setOf("adam", "swamy") 
```

Mutable

```
var names = mutableListof("Alex", "Suraj", "Swamy")
var hashMapNames = mutableHashMapOf("Swamy" to 1, "Suraj" to 2) 
var setNames = mutableSetOf("adam", "swamy") 
```
